## A look at US Government Shutdowns
## Introduction
We are in the midst of the 21st and the record-long US government shutdown. So we asked the question, why is there a government shutdown? We decided to dig a little deeper, and answer few questions that arose: <br>
-Does government unification play a role in government shutting down? <br>
-Historically, what happens to Presidents' Job Approval Ratings as they go in and exit out of a shutdown?<br>
-Similarly, What happens to Congressional Approval Ratings as the government exits a shut down?<br>
-Finally, What is the impact of a shutdown on the "economy" (Using S&P 500 stock Prices)?
